# Autonomous Delivery Robot
As a team of 6 students, we built a robot that can autonomously navigate a track and drop off packages. The track is delimited by two coloured lines (red and blue), and a delivery zone is indicated by a green line perpendicular to the track. Every delivery zone has a coloured drop-off zone, and the robot must drop off the package with the matching colour within the delivery zone. The autonomous delivery robot is built using Lego Mindstorms component and is powered by a RasberryPi. Our robust code allows our robot to have great performance consistently on various tracks and allowed us to pass the professor's tests with full marks.
